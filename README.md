# On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-based Retrieval

This repository contains the official resources for the paper "[On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)".
This work introduces the **LIMIT** dataset,
designed to stress-test embedding models based on theoretical principles.
We show that for any given embedding dimension `d`,
there exists a combination of documents that cannot be returned by any query.
We use this theory to instantiate the dataset LIMIT,
finding that even state-of-the-art models struggle: highlighting a fundamental
limitation of the current single-vector embedding paradigm.

## Data

The datasets used in our experiments are available in the `data/` directory of this repository, formatted in [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) style (i.e. json lines).

Each dataset contains:

- A `queries.json` file containing a line for each of the 1000 queries, each with an `_id` and the `text` field.
- A `corpus.json` file containing a line for each of the 50k (or 46 if using the `small` version) documents, each with an `_id`, `text` and empty `title` field.
- A `qrels.json` file containing rows for each of the 2000 relevant query->doc mappings, mapping `query-id` of the queries into the `corpus-id` in the documents, with `score` indicating relevance.

* **Full Dataset (`limit`):** The complete dataset, containing 50k documents.
  * [Link to `data/limit`](./data/limit)

* **Small Sample (`limit-small`):** A smaller version with only the 46 documents relevant to the queries.
  * [Link to `data/limit-small`](./data/limit-small)
  * [Link to `data/limit-small-synonyms` HF version]([./data/limit-small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/orionweller/LIMIT-small-synonyms))

## Code

We provide code to generate the LIMIT style datasets,
as well as to run the free embedding experiment in the `code/` folder.

* **Dataset Generation:** To generate the dataset from scratch, you can use the Jupyter notebook located at `code/generate_limit_dataset.ipynb`. This contains all necessary steps and dependencies.
  * [Link to `code/generate_limit_dataset.ipynb`](./code/generate_limit_dataset.ipynb)

* **Free Embedding Experiments:** The script to run the free embedding experiments can be found in `code/free_embedding_experiment.py`.

If you use the free embedding code,
you'll need to install the following requirements.

### Installation

We recommend using the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-deepmind/limit/refs/heads/main/code/requirements.txt
```

## Loading with Huggingface Datasets
You can also load the data using the `datasets` library from Huggingface ([LIMIT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/orionweller/LIMIT), [LIMIT-small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/orionweller/LIMIT-small)):
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("orionweller/LIMIT-small", "corpus") # also available: queries, test (contains qrels).
```

## Evaluation

Evaluation was done using the [MTEB framework](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb). You can reproduce this **only on the [v2.0.0 branch](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/tree/w_limit)** (soon to be `main`). Note that the v2.0.0 branch is changing rapidly, so **please install the version pinned in the requirements** until it becomes main. An example is:

```python
import mteb
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# load the model using MTEB
model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
model = mteb.get_model(model_name) # will default to SentenceTransformers(model_name) if not implemented in MTEB
# or using SentenceTransformers
model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)

# select the desired tasks and evaluate
tasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=["LIMITSmallRetrieval"]) # or use LIMITRetrieval for the full dataset
results = mteb.evaluate(model, tasks=tasks)
```
